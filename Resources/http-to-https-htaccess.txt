Redirect All Web Traffic
To force all web traffic to use HTTPS insert the following lines of code in the .htaccess file in your website's root folder.

NOTE: If you have existing code in your .htacess, add this above where there are already rules with a similar starting prefix.



RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/[0-9]+\..+\.cpaneldcv$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/\.well-known/pki-validation/[A-F0-9]{32}\.txt(?:\ Comodo\ DCV)?$
RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]


Redirect Only Specified Domain
To force a specific domain to use HTTPS, use the following lines of code in the .htaccess file in your website's root folder:

NOTE: If you have existing code in your .htacess, add this above where there are already rules with a similar starting prefix.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/[0-9]+\..+\.cpaneldcv$
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/\.well-known/pki-validation/[A-F0-9]{32}\.txt(?:\ Comodo\ DCV)?$
RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^example\.com [NC]
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.example.com/$1 [R=301,L]

Make sure to replace example\.com with the domain name you're trying force to https. Additionally, you need to replace www.example.com with your actual domain name.

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/[0-9]+\..+\.cpaneldcv$

RewriteEngine On 
RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} folder
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.example.com/folder/$1 [R=301,L]
